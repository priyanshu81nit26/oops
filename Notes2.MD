* size of class is 1 as it is template :
* object take the size or size for a class is assigned when its object is created:

* You make constructor private if you want to prevent creating more then one instance of your class.

* if we will create any constructor then compiler will not create any construxtor by itself:

* when we have multiple constructors called and they differ in their parameters , then it is called constructor overloading

* same parameter constructor can be declared only once :
constructor canot be redeclared:
* inside class if we define constructor then it is automatically inline

* destructor is called in reverse order

* pehle hmesha parents class ka constructor call hota h:
* but destructor hmesha phle base class ka call hota h
